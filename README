This was a tough one to get to work with Haskell. Apparently pretty much all of the OpenCV Haskell bindings
are broken/half-implemented, so I had to create my own with FFI.

As usual, I have provided a statically linked binary just in case.

This project took me about 8 to 10 hours to complete.

make with make
run with
    ./jora2470_hw7
